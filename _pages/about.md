I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">School of Public Affairs and Administration</a> at Rutgers University-Newark where I am also co-directing the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/cebpa" target="_blank">Center for Experimental and Behavioral Public Administration</a>.

My academic work applies insights from the behavioral sciences to public management and policy. Substantively, I am interested in how institutional arrangements for public service delivery affect public employees and the people they serve.

I am founding editor (together with Ken Meier and Gregg Van Ryzin) of the <a href="http://www.journal-bpa.org" target="_blank">Journal of Behavioral Public Administration</a>, a not-for-profit, open-access journal, and co-chair the EGPA Permanent Study Group XXII on <a href="http://www.iias-iisa.org/egpa/groups/permanent-study-groups/psg-xxii-xxii-behavioral-public-administration" target="_blank">Behavioral Public Administration</a>.
