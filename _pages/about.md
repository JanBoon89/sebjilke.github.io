I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">School of Public Affairs and Administration</a> at Rutgers University-Newark where I am also co-directing the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/cebpa" target="_blank">Center for Experimental and Behavioral Public Administration</a>.  During the Academic Year 2019-2020, I serve as OES Fellow in the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov" target="_blank">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a> at the General Services Administration in Washington, D.C.

My academic work applies insights from the behavioral sciences to public management and policy. Substantively, I am interested in how institutional and organizational arrangements for public service delivery affect public employees and the people they serve -- especially with regard to social equity in access to public services and programs. 

In 2019, I received the Beryl Radin Award for the best article published in the *Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory (JPART)* for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/28/2/226/4827854" target="_blank">Which Clients are Deserving of Help? A Theoretical Model and Experimental Test</a> (together with <a href="https://larstummers.com" target="_blank">Lars Tummers</a>). I am also co-editor of <a href="http://admin.cambridge.org/se/academic/subjects/management/management-general-interest/experiments-public-management-research-challenges-and-contributions?format=PB#vxdAgU7iD4g0rV2E.97" target="_blank">*Experiments In Public Management Research: Challenges and Contributions*</a> (Cambridge University Press).

I am founding editor (together with Ken Meier and Gregg Van Ryzin) of the <a href="http://www.journal-bpa.org" target="_blank">Journal of Behavioral Public Administration</a>, a not-for-profit, open-access journal, and co-chair the EGPA Permanent Study Group XXII on <a href="http://www.iias-iisa.org/egpa/groups/permanent-study-groups/psg-xxii-xxii-behavioral-public-administration" target="_blank">Behavioral Public Administration</a>.
