I am an assistant professor in the [School of Public Affairs and Administration (SPAA)](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu) at Rutgers University-Newark.  I am also Co-Director of the [Center for Experimental and Behavioral Public Administration](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/cebpa).

I study citizens’ and bureaucrats’ responses to market-type mechanisms in public service delivery.  Relatedly, I also have an ongoing interest in equality in service provision, especially discrimination in access to public programs and services.

Together with Martin Bækgaard, Paola Cantarelli and Lars Tummers I co-chair the EGPA Permanent Study Group XXII on [“Behavioral Public Administration”](http://www.iias-iisa.org/egpa/groups/permanent-study-groups/psg-xxii-xxii-behavioral-public-administration/).

Since 2018, I am editing the [Journal of Behavioral Public Administration](http://www.journal-bpa.org) (together with Kenneth Meier and Gregg Van Ryzin).
