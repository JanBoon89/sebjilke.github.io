I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">School of Public Affairs and Administration</a> at Rutgers University-Newark, where I am also co-directing the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/cebpa" target="_blank">Center for Experimental and Behavioral Public Administration</a>.

My acadmic work applies insight from the behavioral sciences to public policy and admininstration.  Substantively, I am interested in citizens’ and bureaucrats’ responses to market-type mechanisms in public service delivery, and social equity in access to public programs and services.

Together with Martin Bækgaard, Paola Cantarelli and Lars Tummers I co-chair the EGPA Permanent Study Group XXII on [Behavioral Public Administration](http://www.iias-iisa.org/egpa/groups/permanent-study-groups/psg-xxii-xxii-behavioral-public-administration/).

Since 2018, I am editing the [Journal of Behavioral Public Administration](http://www.journal-bpa.org) (together with Kenneth Meier and Gregg Van Ryzin).
