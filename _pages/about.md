I am an assistant professor in the [School of Public Affairs and Administration (SPAA)](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu) at Rutgers University-Newark.  I am also Co-Director of the [Center for Experimental and Behavioral Public Administration](https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/cebpa) at SPAA, and founding editor of the [Journal of Behavioral Public Administration](http://www.journal-bpa.org) (together with Kenneth Meier and Gregg Van Ryzin).

My academic work examines the psychological underpinnings of citizen-state interactions in the realm of public sector reforms.  More specifically, I study citizens’ and bureaucrats’ responses to market-type mechanisms in public service delivery.  Relatedly, I also have an ongoing interest in equality in service provision, and am especially interested in discrimination at the frontline of public services.  Besides my substantial expertise, I have an active research agenda in measurement and (quasi-)experimental techniques.

I received my Ph.D in Public Administration from Erasmus University Rotterdam (the Netherlands).  In my Ph.D. thesis I have studied the microfoundations of introducing choice and competition into public service delivery.  I have looked at how citizens respond to the liberalization of public infrastructure services in terms of their abilities to send market signals to providers (i.e. switching, and complaining), and how this affects inequalities in service provision between different societal layers.

Together with Martin Bækgaard, Paola Cantarelli and Lars Tummers I co-chair the EGPA Permanent Study Group XXII on [“Behavioral Public Administration”](http://www.iias-iisa.org/egpa/groups/permanent-study-groups/psg-xxii-xxii-behavioral-public-administration/).
